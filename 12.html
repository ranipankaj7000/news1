        <h1>Watch: Sanju Samson's no-look sixes sends India cricketers, coaches in frenzy</h1>
        <p>In the video, Iyer was seen hitting no-look sixes while Samson executed the shot twice - once over square leg, the next one was finer towards the long leg. The shots also earned praise from the Indian cricketers and support staff.</p>

        <p>A young Indian batting unit minus Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli, flexed their muscles on the eve of the series-opening first T20I against New Zealand in Wellington. Stand-in captain Hardik Pandya, wicketkeeper-batters Rishabh Pant, Ishan Kishan, Sanju Samson, batters Shreyas Iyer, Shubman Gill, all-rounder Deepak Hooda were all seen practising big hits on Thursday. BCCI shared a video of India's net session in which pretty much all the batters hit lofted shots, giving an indication that the upcoming three-match T20I series against New Zealand, could signal the much-needed change in the approach of India's batting unit./p>
        <p>Of the many shots, Sanju Samson and Shreyas Iyer's no-look big hits were the most attractive ones. Iyer and Samson, both ignored for the T20 World Cup, were seen dispatching the length deliveries while batting on the practice wickets at the Basin Reserve.
